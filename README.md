# Shiny-got Project
Shiny-got is a web application developed using Shiny and R that allows users to explore various aspects of the popular TV series Game of Thrones (GOT). The application is reactive and easy to use, with clear documentation to guide users through its features.

Shiny-got can be hosted on any server, but is particularly well-suited for R servers due to its simplicity and ease of maintenance.
